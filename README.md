# Hi, I'm Robert!

## I'm a lifelong technologist 
... with expertise in Linux systems engineering. As a kid, I taught myself various programming languages: BASIC, assembly, C, C++, Pascal, and Java. Today, my go-to languages are Python and JavaScipt. I'm currently learning Go and may take up Rust next. My first computer was a [Tandy TRS-80 CoCo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_2_(1983%E2%80%931986)) and lived for every issue of [Rainbow Magazine](https://archive.org/details/rainbowmagazine).

## In my professional life
... I've spent most of my [career](https://rsigler.com/) in Systems Engineering (Windows, UNIX, VMWare ESX, and Linux). After taking and passing the [Red Hat Performance Tuning](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcs-performance-tuning) exam, I decided to move into a leadership position, managing teams of cross-discipline technologists. In my current role, I lead an IT operations organization at [McKesson](https://www.mckesson.com/) and love the challenge. My leadership philosophy focuses on the three concepts: empowerment, mentorship, and inclusion.
