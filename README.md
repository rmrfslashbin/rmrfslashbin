# Hi, I'm Robert!

## I'm a lifelong technologist 
... with expertise in Linux systems engineering. As a kid, I taught myself various programming languages: BASIC, assembly, C, C++, Pascal, and Java. Today, my go-to languages are Python and JavaScipt. I'm currently learning Go and may take up Rust next.

## In my professional life
... I've spent most of my career in Systems Engineering (Windows, UNIX, VMWare ESX, and Linux). After taking and passing the Red Hat Performance Tuning exam, I decided to move into a leadership position, managing teams of cross-discipline technologists. In my current role, I lead an IT operations organization at McKesson and love the challenge. My leadership philosophy focuses on the three primary concepts: empowerment, mentorship, and inclusion.
