# Hi, I'm Robert!

## I'm a lifelong technologist
My first computer was a [Tandy TRS-80 CoCo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_2_(1983%E2%80%931986)) and I lived for every issue of [Rainbow Magazine](https://archive.org/details/rainbowmagazine). I taught myself various programming languages: BASIC, assembly, C, C++, Pascal, Java, Javascript, Python, and Go. In my early teenage years, I acquired my first [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) running [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS#MS-DOS_3.x). Eventually, I found [Red Hat Linux 5.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux), paved over [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98), and never looked back!

## My professional life
I've spent most of my [career](https://rsigler.com/) in Systems Engineering (Windows, UNIX, VMWare ESX, and Linux). After taking and passing the [Red Hat Performance Tuning](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcs-performance-tuning) exam, I decided to move into a leadership position, managing teams of cross-discipline technologists. In my current role, I lead an IT operations organization at [McKesson](https://www.mckesson.com/) and love the challenge. My leadership philosophy focuses on the three concepts: empowerment, mentorship, and inclusion.
